          excerpt: >
            When students believe they can get smarter, they understand that
            effort makes them stronger--that's a growth mindset. Such a
            belief is linked to more positive academic outcomes. We are
            actively researching ways to automated assignment provide
            feedback that promote growth mindset beliefs and to foster
            a more positive student experience.

          excerpt: >
            The Programming Exercise Markup Language (PEML) is a simple, easy
            format for CS and IT instructors of all kinds (college, community
            college, high school, whatever) to describe programming assignments
            and activities. We want it to be so easy (and obvious) to use that
            instructors won't see it as a technological or notational barrier
            to expressing their assignments.

            The CxxTest plug-in for Eclipse provides Eclipse users who are
            developing C++ code with a graphical user interface for CxxTest.
            CxxTest is a unit-testing framework for C++ development that
            behaves similarly to Eclipse's native support for JUnit. This
            plug-in provides better integration with Eclipse and the CDT.
