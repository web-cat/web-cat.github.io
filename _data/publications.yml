    This experience report describes lessons learned using first
    generation tablet PCs to support active learning in an
    undergraduate computer science laboratory course. We learned that
    tablet PCs are poorly matched to typical CS laboratory tasks:
    writing, compiling, and testing programs. Pen-based input is
    inadequate for typical program editing tasks, and a pen is less
    effective than a mouse when typing at a keyboard. Students show a
    clear preference for desktop computers in this environment. Nearly
    three quarters of our students preferred a lab supporting wireless
    connectivity, however. Students also believe that the use of
    movable, reconfigurable furniture allows them to work in
    arrangements that are more natural during lab. Overall, students
    preferred the flexibility provided by wireless network access,
    freedom from cables, and movable furniture, but felt tablets were
    ineffective for programming tasks.

  abstract: >
    Automated grading systems have been in use for several years.
    These systems automate part of the grading process by compiling,
    executing and testing student submitted source code. However, such
    systems often fail to include a mechanism to allow instructors or
    grader to provide free form comments on student work. One must
    resort to other methods to provide feedback to students.</p>
    <p>This paper presents the development of a feedback mechanism that
    streamlines the grading process for instructors and teaching
    assistants. A web-based grading tool has been developed that allows
    course staff to enter comments for student programs directly
    through a web browser. This tool is tightly integrated with
    Web-CAT, an automated grader. The result is a one-stop web-based
    interface for students to receive all of their feedback.</p> <p>We
    present the results of an anonymous survey of computer science
    professors from different universities on their expectations with
    respect to TA grading activities for programming assignments, as
    well as the learning outcomes these professors desire for their
    students. In addition, we present the results of interviews with
    teaching assistants in introductory programming level courses to
    learn about the different grading methods they use when grading
    programming assignments. Finally, we report on a usability
    evaluation of the tool itself and discuss directions for future
    work.

    for Eclipse, and adding our own plug-ins for electronic submission
    and for unit testing support in C++, we are able to use Eclipse as
    a portal to all the services our students will need, allowing them
    to accomplish all their tasks entirely within the IDE, from their
    project’s inception to its submission and evaluation.  Further,
    we are able to carry students through the transition from Java
    programming to C++ programming within this same environment.

    Adaptive learning systems aim to precisely tailor education and

    internal model of a user’s current knowledge to adjust the
    navigational affordances and presentation order of material. The
    user model is incrementally built and updated as the user
    demonstrates mastery by completing exercises and tests. Designing
    courses that are delivered adaptively involves addressing many
    complexities.  This paper describes experiences designing the first
    adaptive module in a series intended to teach software testing
    skills. Experiences in using the first module and a preliminary
    evaluation of its effectiveness are presented.

    Students need to learn testing skills, and using test-driven
    development on assignments is one way to help students learn. JUnit
    support in Eclipse provides an integrated unit testing experience
    for Java users, and combined with our automated grading system
    called Web-CAT, we can assess the validity and completeness of
    their test cases. To ease the transition from Java programming to
    C++ programming, we have developed a plug-in to integrate CxxTest,
    a C++ unit testing framework, into Eclipse by using the C
    Development Tools (CDT) to write new incremental builders that
    detect test cases and generate an appropriate runner for them. A
    CxxTest view is also provided that duplicates the look and feel of
    the JUnit view as closely as is appropriate. Further, we have
    created a extensible plug-in that provides an interface that allows
    students to automatically submit their projects to an internet site
    for collection or to an automated grading system such as Web-CAT,
    whose results will be presented to the student directly in the
    Eclipse IDE.

    We can adapt industrial-quality tools for developing, testing, and

    this can be done by taking a sample Resolve/C++ assignment based on
    software testing ideas, building a simple Eclipse project that
    handles build and execution actions for the assignment, writing all
    of the tests using CxxTest, and processing a solution through
    Web-CAT, and flexible automated grading system. Using tool support
    to bring realistic testing practices into the classroom has
    demonstrable learning benefits, and adapting existing tools for use
    with Resolve/C++ will allow these same techniques to be used in
    courses where Resolve/C++ is used.

    Note taking is a common and important classroom activity.  The
    Tablet PC seems to be an obvious choice to support this task.  In
    this paper, we explore its use and some of effects on note taking. 
    To do this, we surveyed students about their note taking styles and
    observed the Tablet PC’s use as a note taking device in lecture
    settings.  From this we found that, due to variations in the speed
    at which they could use the device, in the size of their
    handwriting, and in how they dealt with the digital nature of the
    platform, the Tablet PC does not meet everyone’s needs equally. 
    While our evaluations occurred at the college level, the findings
    are relevant to many other educational venues.

    This workshop provides a practical, hands-on introduction to how
    one can incorporate software testing activities as a regular part
    of programming assignments.  It presents five different models for
    how one can incorporate testing into assignments, provides examples
    of each technique, and discusses the corresponding advantages and
    disadvantages.  Approaches to assessment—using testing to assess
    student code, assessing tests that students write, and automated
    grading—are all discussed.  Advice for writing “testable”
    assignments is given.  Hands-on examples are used throughout to
    illustrate the techniques.

    This paper reports on the issues the authors encountered while
    evaluating the JML-JUnit unit testing strategy. Given a predefined
    set of parameter values, JML-JUnit can automatically provide unit
    tests for Java programs that have specifications. We present a
    mutation testing experiment that evaluates the effectiveness of
    this testing strategy, and the lessons learned from doing this
    experiment. We conclude that a benchmark will enable the testing
    research community to meaningfully assess testing approaches.

    Stephen H. Edwards.  Adding software testing to programming
    assignments.  Tutorial at the 20th Annual ACM SIGPLAN Conference on
    Object Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications,
    October 2005.
  abstract: >
    Software testing is a critical skill for practitioners, but it is
    rarely given appropriate coverage in undergraduate curricula.  If
    we want to change the culture of how students program, they should
    practice basic testing skills on every assignment all the time. 
    This tutorial provides a practical introduction to incorporating
    software testing activities as a regular part of programming
    assignments.  While this can be done for many languages, the focus
    here is on leveraging XUnit-style tools and test-first coding
    techniques to infuse software testing throughout courses that teach
    object-oriented programming concepts.  Empirical evidence suggests
    that, when assignments are transformed this way, students produce
    higher-quality results (averaging 28% fewer bugs/KSLOC) and are
    more likely to turn assignments in on time.  Further, test-first
    strategies preempt “big bang” integration disasters, and
    students report greater confidence in their own work. </p><p> This
    tutorial presents five different models for how one can incorporate
    testing into assignments, provides live programming demonstrations
    of the techniques, and discusses the corresponding advantages and
    disadvantages of each.  Approaches to assessment—using testing to
    assess student code, assessing tests that students write, and
    automated grading—are all discussed.  Advice for writing
    “testable” assignments is given.  Hands-on examples for
    participants are also provided.

  abstract: >
    While there is a long history in our field of “home grown”
    automated grading systems at various institutions, there is
    relatively little sharing of tools or techniques among
    universities.  A number of significant obstacles exist to using
    home grown tools at other institutions, including differences
    in:</p> <ul> <li><p>Authentication mechanisms and integration with
    campus-specific single-sign-on services.</p></li> <li><p>Workflow
    practices in collecting, marking up, and returning
    assignments.</p></li> <li><p>Execution platform(s)

    modularity and flexibility.</p></li> <li><p>and more … </p></li>
    </ul> <p> The purpose of this BOF is to bring together parties
    interested in identifying the major roadblocks to fielding a
    generally-adoptable automated grading platform that is flexible
    enough for use across a wide variety of institutions.  A platform
    providing a modular, plug-in-based architecture could provide a
    common base for advancing the interests of many working in this
    area, as well as a medium for infusing best practices across many
    institutions.  In addition to brainstorming the obstacles, the

  abstract: >
    Within computer science education, automated grading systems are
    used by many institutions. This paper summarizes an investigation
    into how the data collected by an electronic submission system can
    be used to aid students and instructors. Rather than simply
    providing feedback on a single submission, a grading system can
    give a student summary information about individual improvement
    over time, as well as where the student stands with respect to his
    or her peers. We explore graphical presentations—in the form of
    bar charts, histograms, and line charts—of a student’s personal
    progress over time, as well as the student’s current performance
    in relationship to the remainder of the class body. Particular
    attention is paid to how graphs can help the student understand
    likely future outcomes on assignments based on current effort
    expended, and on "calibrating" one’s own understanding of how the
    rest of the class is performing.

    We present our findings on the state of the field of algorithm

    content is distributed among topics, who created algorithm
    visualizations and when, the overall quality of available
    visualizations, and how visualizations are disseminated. We have
    built a wiki that currently catalogs over 350 algorithm
    visualizations, contains the beginnings of an annotated
    bibliography on algorithm visualization literature, and provides
    information about researchers and projects. Unfortunately, we found
    that most existing algorithm visualizations are of low quality, and
    the content coverage is skewed heavily toward easier topics. There
    are no effective repositories or organized collections of algorithm
    visualizations currently available. Thus, the field appears in need
    of improvement in dissemination of materials, informing potential
    developers about what is needed, and propagating known best
    practices for creating new visualizations.

  abstract: >
    Within computer science education, many educators are incorporating
    software testing activities into regular programming assignments. 
    Tools like JUnit and its relatives make software testing tasks much
    easier, bringing them into the realm of even introductory students.
     At the same time, many introductory programming courses are now
    including graphical interfaces as part of student assignments to
    improve student interest and engagement.  Unfortunately, writing
    software tests for programs that have significant graphical user
    interfaces is beyond the skills of typical students (and many
    educators).  This paper presents initial work at combining
    educationally oriented and open-source tools to create an
    infrastructure for writing tests for Java programs that have
    graphical user in-terfaces.  Critically, these tools are intended
    to be appropriate for introductory (CS1/CS2) student use, and to
    dovetail with current teaching approaches that incorporate software
    testing in programming assign-ments.  We also include in our
    findings our proposed approach to evaluating our techniques.

  abstract: >
    In computer science and information technology education,
    instructors often use electronic tools to collect, compile,
    execute, and analyze student assignments.  The assessment results
    produced by these tools provide a large body of data about student
    work habits, the quality of student work, and the areas where
    students are struggling.  This paper reports on efforts to extract
    significantly more useful data from electronically collected
    as-signments in computer programming courses.  The work is being
    performed in the context of the most widely used open-source
    automated grading system: Web-CAT.  We have enhanced a Web-CAT
    plug-in to allow collection of data about the frequency and types
    of run-time errors produced by students, the frequency and types of
    test case failures that occur during grading, basic code size
    metrics, test coverage metrics, and more.  This information can be
    combined with the results of “by-hand” grading activities to
    form a large, rich data corpus characterizing student behavior over
    many assignments in one course, over many courses, and even across
    semesters.  The data collected in this way is a valuable resource
    for researchers in computer science education.

  abstract: >
    Tools like JUnit and its relatives are making software testing
    reachable even for introductory students.  At the same time,
    however, many introductory computer sciences courses use graphical
    interfaces as an “attention grabber” for students and as a
    metaphor for teaching object-oriented programming.  Unfortunately,
    developing software tests for programs that have significant
    graphical user interfaces is beyond the abilities of typical
    students (and, for that matter, many educators).  This paper
    describes a framework for combining readily available tools to
    create an infrastructure for writing tests for Java programs that
    have graphical user interfaces.  These tests are level-appropriate
    for introductory students and fit in with current approaches in
    computer science education that incorporate testing in programming
    assignments.  An analysis of data collected during actual student
    use of the framework in a CS1 course is presented.

    code review exercise. In our activity, we asked students to review
    code, rate it using a rubric, and to justify their explanation. The
    students were asked to review two solutions to a project from a
    previous year. Through examples of their explanations, we found
    that students had a number of basic misunderstandings of
    object-oriented principles. In this paper, we present our
    observations of the misunderstandings, and present some general
    observations of how code reviews can be used as an assessment tool

    Including software testing practices in programming assignments has
    moved from a novel idea to accepted practice in recent years.
    Further, testing frameworks have spurred renewed interest in new
    approaches to automated grading, with some systems specifically
    aiming to give feedback on software testing skills. As more
    educators consider incorporating testing techniques in their own
    courses, lessons learned from using testing in the classroom as
    well as from using automated grading systems become more valuable.
    This paper summarizes experiences in using software testing in CS1-
    and CS2-level courses over the past three years. Among these
    experiences, this paper focuses on student perceptions of automated
    grading tools and how they might be addressed, approaches to
    designing project specifications, and strategies for providing
    meaningful feedback to students that can help improve their
    performance and reduce their frustration.

  abstract: >
    In introductory computer science courses, the Unified Modeling
    Language (UML) is commonly used to teach basic object-oriented
    design. However, there appears to be a lack of suitable software to
    support this task. Many of the available programs that support UML
    focus on developing code and not on enhancing learning. Programs
    designed for educational use sometimes have poor interfaces or are
    missing common and important features such as multiple selection
    and undo/redo. Hence the need for software that is tailored to an
    instructional environment and that has all the useful and needed
    functionality for that specific task. This is the purpose of
    minimUML. It provides a minimum amount of UML, just what is
    commonly used in beginning programming classes, and a simple,
    usable interface. In particular, minimUML is designed to support
    abstract design while supplying features for exploratory learning
    and error avoidance. It supports functionality that includes
    multiple selection, undo/redo, flexible printing, cut and paste,
    and drag and drop. In addition, it allows for the annotation of
    diagrams, through text or free-form drawings, so students can
    receive feedback on their work. minimUML was developed with the
    goals of supporting ease of use, of supporting novice students, and
    of requiring no prior training for its use. This article presents
    the rationale behind the minimUML design, a description of the
    tool, and the results of usability evaluations and student feedback
    on the use of the tool.

    beyond the scope of such AVs to provide students with an
    opportunity to explore the relative merits of various alternatives.
    We call such artifacts “algorithm explorations.” As an
    illustration of what an algorithm exploration might look like, we
    describe a hashing tutorial that we have implemented.

    Proper memory management and pointer usage often prove to be the
    most difficult concepts for students learning C++ to grasp.
    Compounding this problem is the fact that the compilers and runtime
    environments traditionally used to introduce these concepts leave
    much to be desired with regard to generating meaningful diagnostics
    to assist students in tracking down and fixing memory-related
    logical errors. To alleviate this, we have developed Dereferee, an
    advanced yet thin wrapper around C++ pointers that greatly
    increases the quality of these runtime diagnostics, but with
    minimal intrusion into students’ code and the learning process.

    Algorithm visualizations (AVs) and data structure visualizations
    have long held great promise for improving CS Education. While some
    AVs have proved to be pedagogically effective, many have not. Thus,
    developing effective AVs is a challenge. We will discuss current
    trends in AV research, and exchange information about who has
    active projects going and where good AVs can be found. We will
    exchange experiences (good and bad) with their use in the
    classroom. We will discuss mechanisms to encourage community-wide

  abstract: >
    We present findings regarding the state of the field of Algorithm
    Visualization (AV) based on our analysis of a collection of over
    500 AVs. We examine how AVs are distributed among topics, who
    created them and when, their overall quality, and how they are
    disseminated. There does exist a cadre of good AVs and active
    developers. Unfortunately, we found that many AVs are of low
    quality, and coverage is skewed toward a few easier topics. This
    can make it hard for instructors to locate what they need. There
    are no effective repositories of AVs currently available, which
    puts many AVs at risk for being lost to the community over time.
    Thus, the field appears in need of improvement in disseminating
    materials, propagating known best practices, and informing
    developers about topic coverage. These concerns could be mitigated
    by building community and improving communication among AV users
    and developers.

  abstract: >
    Computer science educators spend a lot of effort designing
    programming assignments, and many are willing to share the results
    of this investment. However, sharing of programming assignments
    occurs primarily in an ad hoc manner through informal channels.
    There are no widely used mechanisms that support instructors in
    finding and sharing such resources. Often, the additional work
    required to prepare and self-publish assignment resources in a way
    that others can then adapt or reuse is a significant inhibitor.
    Also, other instructors may have to spend an inordinate amount of
    time and effort to reshape a potential assignment into something
    that can be used in their own courses. This working group report
    proposes a common format for packaging assignments for sharing.
    This format is easy for instructors to create (requiring no
    specialized tools), is extensible and flexible enough to handle
    assignments written for any programming language at any level of
    proficiency, supports appropriate metadata, and is easily
    manipulated by software tools. As more and more instructors use
    automated grading tools to process student submissions, it is our
    hope that such an interchange format can lead to a community
    practice of sharing resources in a way that overcomes existing
    barriers to such reuse.

  abstract: >
    At SIGCSE 2002, Michael Goldwasser suggested a strategy for adding
    software testing practices to programming courses by requiring
    students to turn in tests along with their solutions, and then
    running every student's tests against every other student's
    program. This approach provides a much more robust environment for
    assessing the quality of student-written tests, and also provides
    more thorough testing of student solutions. Although software
    testing is included as a regular part of many more programming
    courses today, the all-pairs model of executing tests is still a
    rarity. This is because student-written tests, such as JUnit tests
    written for Java programs, are now more commonly written in the
    form of program code themselves, and they may depend on virtually
    any aspect of their author's own solution. These dependencies may
    keep one student's tests from even compiling against another
    student's program. This paper discusses the problem and presents a
    novel solution for Java that uses bytecode rewriting to transform a
    student's tests into a form that uses reflection to run against any
    other solution, regardless of any compile-time dependencies that
    may have been present in the original tests. Results of applying
    this technique to two assignments, encompassing 147 student
    programs and 240,158 individual test case runs, shows the
    feasibility of the approach and provides some insight into the
    quality of both student tests and student programs. An analysis of
    these results is presented.

    step, and we must continue to provide support for teaching
    methodologies that we have used in the past, such as test-driven
    development and automated assessment. We have developed RoboLIFT, a
    library that makes unit testing of Android applications
    approachable for students. Furthermore, by supporting existing
    automated grading techniques, we are able to sustain large student
    enrollments, and we evaluate the effects that using Android has had
    on student performance.

    described, with links to online resources for several existing
    instruments. The setup of a within-subjects design using pre- and
    post-tests at each end of a semester-long programming course allows
    changes in attitudes to be assessed. Results from analyzing 197
    surveys received over a two-semester period are presented. Most
    attitude measures were quite high. The only significant change was
    an increase in the perceived importance of computing among the
    students. However, student aversion scores were a significant
    predictor of student success. Lessons learned are presented along
    with future plans.

  abstract: >
    Beginning programmers often have difficulty interpreting exceptions
    and using the associated messages to pinpoint the cause of
    incorrect program behavior. When an interactive development
    environment (IDE) presents a novice developer with a runtime time
    exception, it generally provides with a stack trace and a limited,
    cryptic exception message that is hard for a beginner to interpret.
    This paper describes ExceptionDoctor, a Java utility that solves
    this problem. ExceptionDoctor intercepts exceptions thrown by
    student code and improves the embedded exception messages to
    provide level-appropriate descriptions. ExceptionDoctor also
    examines the source code that produced the exception (if available)
    in order to describe the immediate cause of the exception in
    student-level terms.

    a significant amount of time to learn. LIFT takes the approach that
    unit testing GUIs should be no different than testing any other
    type of code. By providing a set of frequently used filters for
    identifying GUI components and a set of operations for acting on
    those components, LIFT lets programmers quickly and easily test
    their GUI applications.

  abstract: >
    Algorithm visualizations (AVs) are widely viewed as having the
    potential for improving computer science education. However, the
    rate of AV use and overall impact on education does not match the
    positive interest in their use that instructors report. Surveys of
    CS faculty show that impediments to successful use of AVs in the
    classroom include difficulties in finding quality AVs on desired
    topics, difficulties in adapting AVs to a given classroom setting,
    and lack of knowledge on the best way to deploy AVs. This indicates
    a need for better support for instructors, to get them past these
    barriers. We seek to provide this support through an online
    educational community that relies on a new model based less on the
    "digital library" approach of information gained by going to a site
    and searching. Instead, the focus is on community-added content
    through members' discussions, reviews, and ratings of content
    items. The AlgoViz community effort will better focus the future
    direction of AV development and use.

    Computer science students need experience with essential concepts
    and professional activities. Peer review is one way to meet these
    goals. In this work, we examine the students' attitudes towards and
    engagement in the peer review process, in early, object-oriented,
    computer science courses. To do this, we used peer review exercises
    in two CS2 classes at neighboring universities over the course of a
    semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one
    reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding
    exercises), we measured the students' attitudes, their perceptions
    of their abilities, and how many of the reviews they completed. We
    found moderately positive attitudes that generally increased over
    time but were not significantly different between groups. We also
    saw a lower completion rate for students reviewing peers than for
    the other groups. The students' internal motivation, as measured by
    their need for cognition, was not shown to be strongly related to
    their attitudes nor to the number of assignments completed.
    Overall, our results show a strong need for external motivation to
    help engage students in peer reviews.

    information systems, and information technology. Ensemble aims to
    provide much needed support for the many distinct yet overlapping
    educational programs in computing and their associated communities.
    To do this, Ensemble takes the form of a distributed portal
    providing access to the broad range of existing educational
    resources while preserving the collections and their associated
    curatorial processes. Ensemble encourages contribution, use, reuse,
    review, and evaluation of educational materials at multiple levels

    implementation, and operation of distributed portals. Here we
    articulate 8 key principles for distributed portals (PDPs). While
    our focus is on education and pedagogy, we expect that our
    experiences will generalize to other digital library application
    domains. These principles inform, facilitate, and enhance the
    Ensemble R&D and production activities. They allow us to provide a
    broad range of services, from personalization to coordination
    across communities. The eight PDPs can be briefly summarized as:
    (1) Articulation across communities using ontologies. (2) Browsing
    tailored to collections. (3) Integration across interfaces and
    virtual environments. (4) Metadata interoperability and
    integration. (5) Social graph construction using logging and
    metrics. (6) Superimposed information and annotation integrated
    across distributed systems. (7) Streamlined user access with IDs.

  abstract: >
    In our introductory computer programming courses, students submit
    their code to an automated grading system for assessment, and they
    are allowed to make an unlimited number of attempts before the
    assignment is closed. This sequence of submissions can be viewed as
    time series data where each attempt gives rise to one or more data
    points, or events, that describe either an action that the student
    has taken or a result of those actions. Frequent episode mining is
    a data mining technique that lets us discover frequently occurring
    patterns in time series data. We apply this technique with data
    generated during one of our courses in order to better understand
    the behaviors of our students during the time that they work on a
    programming assignment. This paper presents an examination of the
    trends that we discovered in our student data.

  abstract: >
    Unless there is a dramatic shift in the attitudes of society in the
    next seven years, plagiarism will continue to be a problem in 2016,
    as it is today, and as it has been.  At institutions where an honor
    court enforces plagiarism rules, when students are accused of
    plagiarism, a group of the students’ peers serve as a jury to
    render a verdict on the charges.  The members of the honor court
    are usually sourced from across the institution, which can present
    difficulties when they are asked to hear cases of alleged source
    code plagiarism, as many may have little to no computer programming
    experience.  A survey of honor court members, the results of which
    will be discussed in this paper, indicates that they tend to rely
    on evidence presented by automated plagiarism detection systems
    over their own ability to assess whether or not plagiarism has
    taken place.

  abstract: >
    Intelligent tutoring systems and other adaptive instructional
    technologies facilitate learning by customizing feedback to
    students’ struggles. However, adaptability of expert systems can
    come at the sake of versatility. Developing software to assist
    students in a particular domain can be challenging; to then apply
    its expertise and pedagogical approach to another domain can be
    both challenging and inappropriate. CoPractice is a web-centered
    practice environment that uses community-contributed content to
    establish a versatile system that adapts to learners based on
    measurements of their knowledge. Selection of both questions and
    feedback are based on persistent measurements of their

  abstract: >
    In computer science, students could benefit from exposure to
    critical programming concepts from multiple perspectives. Peer
    review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses
    of the concepts in a non-programming manner. In this work, we
    examine the use of the peer review process in early,
    object-oriented, computer science courses as a way to develop the
    reviewers' knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts,
    specifically Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation.</p> <p>
    To study these ideas, we used peer review exercises in two CS2
    classes at local universities over the course of a semester. Using
    three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the
    instructor, and one completing small design or coding exercises),
    we measured the students' conceptual understanding throughout the
    semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found
    that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially
    those reviewing the instructor's programs. Overall, peer reviews
    are a valuable method for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students
    and can be used as an alternative way to learn object-oriented
    programming concepts.
